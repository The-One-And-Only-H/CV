# My Curriculum Vitae

<p>(My pronouns are they/them)</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>My name is H. I currently work full-time as a Full Stack Developer for a digital design agency based in Shoreditch, London called Neverbland. I also volunteer as a coach with Codebar teaching students basic programming skills. Prior to this, I worked for a homelessness charity in Brighton and was part of the third sector in both paid and voluntary roles for the past ten years. I see myself as an ambitious and driven character who enjoys a good challenge. Coding has scratched my problem-solving itch and I am keen to develop my computer programming skills and grow within the tech industry.</p>
