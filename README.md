# My Curriculum Vitae

<h1>H</h1>
<p>(My pronouns are they/them)</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>My name is H (my pronouns are they/them). I currently work remotely full-time as a QA Engineer for a health tech company based in Berlin called Doctorly. Prior to this, I was a Full Stack Developer for a digital design agency based in London called Neverbland. I also volunteer as a coach with Codebar teaching students basic programming skills. 

Before entering the tech industry, I worked for a homelessness charity in Brighton and was part of the third sector in both paid and voluntary roles for the past ten years. I see myself as an ambitious and driven character who enjoys a good challenge. Coding has scratched my problem-solving itch and I am keen to develop my computer programming skills and grow within the tech industry.</p>
