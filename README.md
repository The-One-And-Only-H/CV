# My Curriculum Vitae

<h1>H</h1>
<p>(my pronouns are they/them)</p>

<h1>Who am I?</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is H and I am a self-taught developer. I currently work full-time for a homelessness charity in Brighton and have been working in the third sector in both paid and voluntary roles for the past ten years. I see myself as an ambitious and driven character who enjoys a good challenge. Coding has scratched my problem solving itch and now I want to do it as more than just a hobby.</p>


<h1>How have I taught myself?</h1>
<h2>Codebar</h2>
<p>After expressing an interest in career change to a friend of mine last year, they suggested attending Codebar to see if computer programming might be of interest. I completed their HTML tutorial during my first visit and I was hooked. I began exploring online resources so as to expand my coding knowledge and soon moved onto learning CSS and JavaScript with Codecademy whilst watching video tutorials on Pluralsight. Given I currently work full-time, I spent every evening in the local library, dedicating my free time to code.</p> 

<h2>Python</h2>
<p>fter I'd spent several months studying front-end development, I began my exploration of backend coding and discovered Python. This was partially thanks to reading Allen B. Downey’s “How to Think Like a Computer Scientist”. This language quickly developed a special place in my heart, largely owing to it's clean and concise syntax. So after teaching myself the fundamentals, I decided I wanted to teach myself by building a project.</p>

<h2>TREP</h2>
<p>I decided to choose a subject that is close to my heart and so The Rainbow Encyclopedia Project (TREP) was born. I wanted to showcase the many prominent figures throughout LGBT history in such a way that is engaging and user friendly. Initially I developed the front-end code, starting with design, layout and functionality, using a mix of the skills I'd learned with HTML, CSS, and some jQuery. The generation of the actual site was done using Python scripting to compose the final output. I then manually pushed the static HTML to GitHub for deployment, which you can see here: https://github.com/The-One-And-Only-H/TREP</p> 

<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>Having experimented with some jQuery, I decided to take a few steps back. I wanted to utilise the foundations of my understanding of JavaScript. Since then, I have begun constructing a professional website for a friend, only this time I really wanted to challenge myself. So I set myself the goal of creating an entire website with minimal HTML whilst making the most of raw JS. You can check out this project here: https://github.com/The-One-And-Only-H/jasminewebsite</p>
  
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>Having attended several job interviews already, one problem I have continually experienced is my lack of professional experience of using code in the work place. As a self-taught developer, this has been my main hurdle to overcome in securing myself a job in the tech industry. I have therefore been tackling my current job from the perspective of a developer and have since managed to find myself a task where I can use my knowledge of programming to everyone's benefit. In short, a large database in the form of an Excel spreadsheet needed reorganising and so, rather than attempting to solve this manually, I wrote a Python script instead, which you can see here: https://github.com/The-One-And-Only-H/spreadsheetorganisation</p>

<h2>What I want to do next?</h2>
<p>I want to improve upon my knowledge of JavaScript with a view to eventually familiarising myself with the React library. I also have an interest in exploring Node.js owing to my interest in back-end code. Going on from this, I would like to develop my skills in Python, which I would like to start using for web applications. Because of this, I would similarly like to explore Django with a view to building an updatable and dynamic version of my project TREP. While I have an interest in back-end development, I am also keen to expand my understanding of JavaScript and other front-end technologies.</p>

<h2>Code Brunch</h2>
<p>Additionally, I have recently set up a new group in Brighton entitled Code Brunch, which endeavours to be a regular coding event for women, trans people and non-binary folk to help each other work on their own projects in a safe and supportive space. The first public event took place in the last week of July and has successfully been going every month since.</p>
