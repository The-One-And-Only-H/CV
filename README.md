<h1>H</h1>
(my pronouns are they/them)

Who am I?
Hello! My name is H and I am a self-taught developer. I currently work full-time for a local homelessness charity and have been working in the third sector in both paid and voluntary roles for the past ten years. I see myself as an ambitious and driven character who enjoys a good challenge. Coding has scratched my problem solving itch and now I want to do it as more than just a hobby.


How have I taught myself?
Codebar
After expressing an interest in career change to a friend of mine last year, they suggested attending Codebar to see if computer programming might be of interest. I completed their HTML tutorial during my first visit and I was hooked. I began exploring online resources so as to expand my coding knowledge and soon moved onto learning CSS and JavaScript with Codecademy whilst watching video tutorials on Pluralsight. Given I currently work full-time, I spent every evening in the Jubilee Library, dedicating my free time to code. 

Python
After I'd spent several months studying front-end development, I began my exploration of backend coding and discovered Python. This was partially thanks to reading Allen B. Downey’s “How to think like a computer scientist”. Where the syntax of JavaScript was messy and verbose, Python was clean and concise. So after teaching myself the fundamentals, I decided I wanted to teach myself by building a project.

TREP
I decided to choose a subject that is close to my heart and so The Rainbow Encyclopedia Project (TREP) was born. I wanted to showcase the many prominent figures throughout LGBT history in such a way that is engaging and user friendly.

Initially I developed the front-end code, starting with design, layout and functionality, using a mix of the skills I'd learned with HTML, CSS, and some jQuery. The generation of the actual site was done using Python scripting to compose the final output. I then manually pushed the static HTML to GitHub for deployment, which you can see here: https://github.com/The-One-And-Only-H/TREP 


What I want to do next?
I want to improve upon my knowledge of Python, which I would like to start using for web applications hence why I am now beginning to teach myself Django, with a view to building an updatable and dynamic version of my project TREP. While I certainly want to focus on back-end development, I am also interested in expanding my understanding of JavaScript and other front-end technologies.

Additionally, I have recently set up a new group in Brighton entitled Code Brunch, which endeavours to be a regular coding event for women, trans people and non-binary folk to help each other work on their own projects in a safe and supportive space. Our first public event will be the last week of July.
