<h1>Who am I?</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is H and I am a self-taught developer. I currently work full-time for a homelessness charity in Brighton and have been working in the third sector in both paid and voluntary roles for the past ten years. I see myself as an ambitious and driven character who enjoys a good challenge. Coding has scratched my problem solving itch and now I want to do it as more than just a hobby.</p>

<h1>How have I taught myself?</h1>
<h2>Codebar</h2>
<p>After expressing an interest in career change to a friend of mine last year, they suggested attending Codebar to see if computer programming might be of interest. I completed their HTML tutorial during my first visit and I was hooked. I began exploring online resources so as to expand my coding knowledge and soon moved onto learning CSS and JavaScript with Codecademy whilst watching video tutorials on Pluralsight. Given I currently work full-time, I spent every evening in the local library, dedicating my free time to code.</p> 

<h2>Python</h2>
<p>After I'd spent several months studying front-end development, I began my exploration of backend coding and discovered Python. This was partially thanks to reading Allen B. Downey’s “How to Think Like a Computer Scientist”. This language quickly developed a special place in my heart, largely owing to it's clean and concise syntax. So after teaching myself the fundamentals, I decided I wanted to teach myself by building a project.</p>

<h2>TREP</h2>
<p>I decided to choose a subject that is close to my heart and so The Rainbow Encyclopedia Project (TREP) was born. I wanted to showcase the many prominent figures throughout LGBT history in such a way that is engaging and user friendly. Initially I developed the front-end code, starting with design, layout and functionality, using a mix of the skills I'd learned with HTML, CSS, and some jQuery. The generation of the actual site was done using Python scripting to compose the final output. I then manually pushed the static HTML to GitHub for deployment, which you can see here: https://github.com/The-One-And-Only-H/TREP</p> 

<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>Having experimented with some jQuery, I decided to take a few steps back. I wanted to utilise the foundations of my understanding of JavaScript. Since then, I have begun constructing a professional website for a friend, only this time I really wanted to challenge myself. So I set myself the goal of creating an entire website with minimal HTML whilst making the most of raw JS. You can check out this project here: https://github.com/The-One-And-Only-H/jasminewebsite</p>
  
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>Having attended several job interviews already, one problem I have continually experienced is my lack of professional experience of using code in the work place. As a self-taught developer, this has been my main hurdle to overcome in securing myself a job in the tech industry. I have therefore been tackling my current job from the perspective of a developer and have since managed to find myself a task where I can use my knowledge of programming to everyone's benefit. In short, a large database in the form of an Excel spreadsheet needed reorganising and so, rather than attempting to solve this manually, I wrote a Python script instead, which you can see here: https://github.com/The-One-And-Only-H/spreadsheetorganisation</p>

<h2>What do I want to do next?</h2>
<p>I want to improve upon my knowledge of JavaScript with a view to eventually familiarising myself with the React library. I also have an interest in exploring Node.js owing to my interest in back-end code. Going on from this, I would like to develop my skills in Python, which I would like to start using for web applications. Because of this, I would similarly like to explore Django with a view to building an updatable and dynamic version of my project TREP. While I have an interest in back-end development, I am also keen to expand my understanding of JavaScript and other front-end technologies.</p>

<h2>What am I looking for in my next job?</h2>
<p>I am hoping to join a friendly team with which I can grow in a co-dependent working environment. I would like for my role to include both support and appreciation of my skills and contributions, and to be given the opportunity to build and create upon the tasks I am given.</p>

<h2>Code Brunch</h2>
<p>Additionally, I have recently set up a new group in Brighton entitled Code Brunch, which endeavours to be a regular coding event for women, trans people and non-binary folk to help each other work on their own projects in a safe and supportive space. The first public event took place in the last week of July and has successfully been going every month since. You can check out the group details on Facebook here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/206177746699309/</p>

<h1>My professional career</h1>
<p>Since 2011, I have gained experience of working in a variety of workplaces, ranging from third sector to advertising. The majority of these roles have largely comprised of both marketing and administrative work. I have subsequently developed strong organisational and interpersonal skills, as well as experience of liasing with both clients and contractors, alongside other stakeholders. At the moment, I currently work for a homelessness charity called Brighton Housing Trust and have been a part of the organisation since 2015. I am however ready for a career change and excited for what my future in tech will hold. Should you require a more detailed description of my career history, please feel free to get in touch for more info.</p>

<h1>My voluntary career</h1>
<p>I am a big believer in giving back to the community and have dedicated the past ten years towards various forms of voluntary work. This has included working within human rights and social issues, and has taken me as far as California where I was given the amazing opportunity to work with and support refugees from North Korea. I have also done a lot of work with various LGBT Pride groups, including London, Brighton and Hertfordshire Pride. On top of this is an assortment of voluntary work, including teaching young adults how to sail, looking after abandoned rescue animals and co-organising a mini literature festival. At the moment, I currently volunteer as an LGBT worker for my current employer, Brighton Housing Trust. This involves providing support to and creating safe spaces for LGBT members of the homeless community, which is something I have been doing for the past three years since I began working for BHT. Should you require a more detailed description of my volunteer history, please feel free to get in touch for more info.</p>

<h1>My qualifications</h1>
<p>Despite being offered to attend the Royal Holloway University of London to do a joint BA in Classical Civilisation and Philosophy, I decided to pursue my professional career instead. Prior to this, I attended the Royal Masonic School for Girls in Hertfordshire and came away with three top grade A levels in Classical Civilisation, French and English Literature, as well as two AS levels in Physics and Maths.</p> 	

<h1>My hobbies</h1>
<p>My number one favourite thing to do in my spare time is to attend rock concerts, which I have been doing consistently since the age of 15. I also have an appreciation for theatre and recently went to see Bryan Cranston perform the 1976 film Network at the National Theatre. Alongside this, I dabble in photography and enjoy singing (badly).</p>

<h1>Contact me!</h1>
<p>I am currently seeking either remote part-time freelance work and/or full-time work as a junior developer in either London or Brighton. Feel free to drop me a line sometime: 07497 018 232 / juana.galan@outlook.com and check out my LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/the-h/</p>
