# My Curriculum Vitae

<h1>H</h1>
<p>(My pronouns are they/them)</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Hi there! My name's H. I've been working in the tech industry for just over 5 years now and love it!

I currently work remotely full-time as a QA Engineer for a health tech company based in Berlin called Doctorly. Prior to this, I was a Full Stack Developer for a digital design agency based in London called Neverbland. Before that, I was a Junior Python Developer for a financial consultancy firm called Inneoin. I also volunteer as a coach with Codebar teaching students from minority backgrounds basic programming skills. 

I have a strong passion for learning that extends beyond tech. I'm a native English speaker who also speaks French and is currently taking one to one private tutoring lessons to learn both German and Spanish. I'm also occasionally picking up Italian in my spare time.

I also have a passion for voluntary work and used to volunteer for a homelessness charity in Brighton for five years. I have volunteered for several charitable and non-profit organisations working in human rights, LGBTQ work, animal welfare and more. 

I see myself as an ambitious and driven character who enjoys a good challenge. Coding has scratched my problem-solving itch and I am keen to further develop my computer programming skills and grow within the tech industry.</p>
